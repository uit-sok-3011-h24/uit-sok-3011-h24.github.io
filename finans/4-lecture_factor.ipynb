    "# Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT)\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) tells us that the expected risk premium of an asset is proportional to that of the market:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "E[r_i | r_M] - r_f = \\beta_i (r_M - r_f) \\tag{1}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "However, CAPM has several shortcomings. First, its theoretical derivation requires a number of assumptions that are quite restrictive. For example, for CAPM to hold in equilibrium, everyone must hold identical portfolios, which we know is not true in reality. \n",
    "\n",
    "Second, empirical evidence suggests that expected returns depend on more than just the market factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The idea of the Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT)\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1976, Stephen Ross proposed the Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT), which relies on the following assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Risky returns can be explained by a factor model.\n",
    "2. There are sufficient assets to diversify away any idiosyncratic risk.\n",
    "3. Well-functioning markets do not allow the persistence of arbitrage opportunities.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "With the first assumption above, the return of asset $i$ can be described by a one-factor model:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "r_i = \\mu_i + \\beta_{i,F} F + e_i \\tag{2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $ \\mu_i $ is the unconditional expected return,\n",
    "- $ F $ is the factor risk premium,\n",
    "- $ \\beta_{i,F} $ is the asset's exposure to the factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we consider the factor $F$ as the market return, we get the realized CAPM:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "r_i - r_f = \\beta_{i,F} (r_M - r_f) + e_i \\tag{3}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This differs from the expected CAPM in that the left-hand term is not an expectation, and the right-hand term includes a residual term $e_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The term $e_i$ represents the unexplained asset return, or idiosyncratic risk, which is uncorrelated with any known factors affecting other assets. It is also uncorrelated with other assets. This independence means that the total variance of idiosyncratic risk in a portfolio is simply the sum of the idiosyncratic contributions from each asset.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, let's assume we have a portfolio of $n$ assets with equal weights $1/n$, and that the idiosyncratic variance is identical across assets: $\\text{var}[e_i] = \\sigma_e^2$. The contribution of each asset to the total variance is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{var}\\left[\\frac{1}{n} e_i \\right] = \\frac{1}{n^2} \\sigma_e^2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since there are $ n $ such contributions, the total idiosyncratic variance of the portfolio will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{var}\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n} e_i \\right) = n \\cdot \\text{var}\\left[\\frac{1}{n} e_i \\right] = \\frac{1}{n} \\sigma_e^2 \\tag{4}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, as the number of assets $n$ increases, the total idiosyncratic variance diminishes. For large $n$, the idiosyncratic variance becomes negligible."

    "## Two Portfolios – One Factor\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume that we have two large, well-diversified portfolios, A and B, with zero idiosyncratic risk. Both portfolios depend on the same factor:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "r_A = \\mu_A + \\beta_A F\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This strategy has zero exposure to the factor, meaning the investment is risk-free, even in the short run. If the return from this position is positive, there exists an arbitrage opportunity because all risk has been removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we would expect investors to buy stocks in portfolio A and sell stocks in portfolio B. Portfolio A's price would rise, and portfolio B's price would fall, until expected returns are equalized. Therefore, in equilibrium:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The risk-adjusted expected return must be the same for any pair of portfolios. Hence, with only one factor (e.g., the market index), all variation in returns should, in equilibrium, be explained by different exposures to that factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Three Portfolios – Two Factors\n",
    "\n",
    "We can extend this idea by adding additional factors. These factors could be macroeconomic (GDP, inflation, etc.) or firm-specific characteristics (size, performance). These categories can be treated as factors.\n",

    "We can cancel out the effect of factor $F_2$ the same way as in the previous section, by dividing each equation by the factor loading. As in the previous section, the resulting portfolio is a zero-cost, risk-free portfolio, which must return zero in the absence of arbitrage:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{\\mu_{AB}}{\\beta_{AB}} = \\frac{\\mu_{BC}}{\\beta_{BC}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since both these \"portfolios of portfolios\" depend on only one factor, the expected returns from equations (11) and (12) must be the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we can extend the simple case with one factor to any number of factors. The general conclusion is that:\n",
    "\n",
    "> In equilibrium, all variation in expected returns is explained by different exposures to factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "This finding is consistent with empirical observations. As we will see, asset returns systematically depend on a number of factors beyond just the market factor. This observation aligns with the Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT) but contradicts the traditional CAPM, which assumes only one factor (the market).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The general case\n",
    "\n",
    "The Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT) tells us that portfolios generally depend on various factors. The return of a portfolio $P$ can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "r_P = \\mu_P + \\beta_1 F_1 + \\beta_2 F_2 + \\cdots + \\beta_n F_n \\tag{17}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If all investors held the same portfolio, there could only be one such factor: the market index. The fact that the APT model is more consistent with empirical evidence than the CAPM is a clear indication that investors do not hold identical portfolios.\n",
    "\n",
    "APT is much more flexible than CAPM, allowing any factor to be used as an explanatory variable in addition to the market index. The factors do not need to be independent. The independent factor portfolios are merely a tool to explain why differences in return must be explained by differences in factor loadings.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of APT's strengths is that it does not require strong assumptions. The most important assumption is the absence of arbitrage, a reasonable approximation in most financial markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples of Factors\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some examples of factors that can be used in APT:\n",
    "\n",
    "- % change in industrial production\n",
    "- % change in expected inflation\n",
    "- % change in unanticipated inflation\n",
    "- Excess return of corporate bonds over government bonds\n",
    "- Excess return of long-term bonds over short-term bonds/certificates\n",
    "- Return of small firms relative to big firms\n",
    "- Return of firms with high book-to-market value relative to those with low B/M ratios.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The Fama-French Three-Factor Model\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1993, Eugene Fama and Kenneth R. French introduced the following two additional factors to explain asset returns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **SMB** (Small Minus Big): The return difference between small and large companies.\n",
    "- **HML** (High Minus Low): The return difference between companies with high and low book-to-market ratios.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using these factors in addition to the market factor, the Fama-French model can be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "r_i = \\alpha_i + \\beta_M (r_M - r_f) + \\beta_{SMB} \\cdot SMB + \\beta_{HML} \\cdot HML + e_i \\tag{18}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This formulation has been very successful in explaining excess returns. Below is a diagram that shows the efficient frontier constructed from the market, SMB, and HML. It shows that the market portfolio lies quite far inside the frontier, suggesting that the gains from betting on HML or SMB could be substantial.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Visualization of Efficient Frontiers\n",
    "\n",

    "## Implications of Fama-French Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The Fama-French model became a market standard for measuring the performance of fund managers, where $r_i$ is the return of the fund. Historically, most evidence suggested that fund managers, as a group, were not able to outperform the index. However, some managers consistently beat the market.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the Fama-French three-factor model, it was revealed that many of these managers systematically bet on small companies or those with high book-to-market ratios—strategies that can easily be automated. However, it is not obvious that such a strategy will always succeed, as factor returns can vary substantially over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Simulation: Dynamic Factor Betting\n",
    "\n",

    "The results show that long-term strategic factor betting outperforms short-term dynamic strategies. The equal weights strategy performs almost as well as the long-term strategy, and given that we have not accounted for transaction costs, it may actually be the best alternative.\n",
    "\n",
    "This suggests that if investors want to bet on factors, they should take a long-term perspective and avoid making frequent adjustments to their portfolios."
