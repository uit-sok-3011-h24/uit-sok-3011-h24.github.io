        "-   **Risk-Averse Investors:** These individuals have concave utility\n",

        "    Commonly modeled in financial theory, risk-averse investors\n",
        "    prioritize minimizing risk over maximizing returns. They tend to\n",

        "    volatility. Even with the option of unlimited borrowing, they\n",

        "    indifference to the level of risk associated with any investment.\n",
        "    They focus solely on maximizing expected returns and are likely to\n",
        "    invest in the asset with the highest expected payoff, irrespective\n",
